This is Gamsock, a sockets library for Gambit with an API that closely
corresponds with scsh's socket API. It was written by Jeffrey T. Read
<bitwize@gmail.com> and released under the license terms as given in the
file COPYING (basically, the same as scsh's license).

To build, assuming your gambit is in $HOME/local/Gambit-C/bin:

    make

Then you can do a (load "gamsock.o1") and all should be well. If your
Gambit is not located in the path above, you can change the
GAMBIT_PATH variable in the Makefile to point to it.

Stay tuned for future versions, with special guest stars: socket options, and
database info (DNS, protocol names, etc.)! Keep those bug reports coming!
